 The World Happiness Report is a global survey assessing happiness levels, used by governments and organizations for policymaking. It ranks 155 countries based on the Cantril ladder question, where respondents rate their life satisfaction from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). The report's factors, like economic production and social support, explain variations in happiness but don't affect the total score. Dystopia is an imaginary benchmark representing the least-happy country, used for comparisons. Residuals show unexplained variations in happiness. Columns following the Happiness Score, like GDP per Capita and Generosity, describe how specific factors contribute to happiness. Combining these factors yields the happiness score, but modeling them to predict scores may be unreliable.
